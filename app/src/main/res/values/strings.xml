    <string name="about_text">\
This game is played just like
regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to win a tile
you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\
\n\
A tie happens when there are no further moves.
In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for
both sides in the larger game.

    <string name="intro">\
    The game consists of nine 3 by 3 boards as shown in picture
        \n\ In each 3*3 board, you will enjoy playing the awesome game of Boggle.
        \n\ The timer runs for 90 seconds.
        \n\ However there is a secret bonus round which can come anytime during the game play but only once during the game.
         During that 3 second window, a flying brick will appear which will change its position every second.
        \n\ Your goal is to catch the brick and press it.
        \n\ If you are able to do so, your timer resets to 90 seconds even if you have 1 second left before.
        \n\ The scoring is Simple: Words greater than 6 will be valued
        as 4 points per character
         Other words will get you 2 points per character!
        \n\ Just a word of caution- The world is made open to you as a challenge. You can jump from 1 box to another after submitting each small square word.
        \n\ But the longest word can still be of 9 characters.
        \n\ Good Luck!
